      <h1>Statistics on Orca Population</h1>
      <p><img src="../Images/Orca History Images/statistics-for-history.jpg" width="300" height="300" class="finalproject">The most recent estimate places the global population at a minimum of about 50,000 animals.13 In the northeastern Pacific (from California to the western Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea), the population is estimated around 2,500 killer whales.Found in all oceans of the world, orcas are most common in the Arctic and Antarctic and are often spotted off the west coast of the United States and Canada. Orcas are found in both coastal waters and open ocean. J Pod<strong> </strong>is the pod most likely to appear year-round in the waters of the San Juan Islands and Southern Gulf Islands, lower Puget Sound (near Seattle), and Georgia Strait. This 25-member pod tends to frequent the west side of San Juan Island in mid to late spring. The oldest member of J pod is J2 (Granny), estimated to be 103 years old. J pod's mature males are now J26, J27 and J34. J pod had one new calf  in 2012, J49 (male), the first calf of J37. With only 19 members, K Pod is the smallest of the three pods in the Southern Resident Killer Whale community. The two oldest females in K pod are K12 and K13, both estimated to have been born in 1972. K pod has three mature males, K21, and K26, and K25.  The most recent calf born into K pod is K44 (male, born 2011), the first known calf of K27.L Pod<strong> </strong>is by far the largest of the three Southern Resident pods. Its members currently total 35. L pod's mature males are L41, L84, L85, L87 and L88. L87 has been traveling with J pod since 2010. L pod had one new calf born in 2012, L119. L119 is the second and only surviving calf of L77.</p>
