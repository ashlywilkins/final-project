      <h1>Hunting Concerns</h1>
      <p><img src="../Images/Orca History Images/hunting-issues.jpg" width="300" height="300" class="finalproject">The first records of commercial hunting of killer whales date to the 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, and the difficulty of taking them.[130] Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 killer whales andNorway took 987.[185] Over 3,000 killer whales were taken by Soviet whalers,[186] including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979–80 alone, prompting the International Whaling Commissionto recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research.[185]Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts. Killer whales have helped humans hunting other whales.[187] One well-known example was in Eden, Australia, including the male known as Old Tom. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as they would gather to scavenge meat from the whalers' catch.[187] Some populations, such as in Alaska's Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.</p>
