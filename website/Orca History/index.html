      <h1>Orca History</h1>
      <p><img src="../Images/Specific Section Home Page Images/orca-1.jpg" width="300" height="300" class="finalproject">The truth about killer whales was not discovered until recently in the last couple of decades. Before people researched and spent a large amount of time actually studying killer whales, the whales had a much more horrible reputation than they do now. Killer whales got the nickname &quot;killer&quot; because of how they were often portrayed in books or stories. The Orca was also very well knwon to be a spiritual animal for Native Americans. For a very long time people feared the blackfish as it crept upon the surface of the dark waters with its pod of other &quot;killers.&quot; People finally started to understand how friendly these mammals were once they went out and spent some time with them. They noticed how they played with one another and even on occasion with the people observing them. Over time we have come to learn so very much about these magical creatures and we continue to learn more about their species from their positive interaction with us every day.</p>
