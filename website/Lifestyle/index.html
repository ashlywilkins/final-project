      <h1>Lifestyle</h1>
      <p><img src="../Images/Specific Section Home Page Images/orca-2.jpg" width="300" height="300">The lifestyle of an Orca whale is very simple for they are cretures that need not much more than the comfort of their family to get by. Orca whales are very friendly and one of the most intelligent animals on earth. They have a part of their brain that humans do not even have. This part of the brain allows their social interaction to be much more important to their lifestyle than us. Orca whales are meant to live in a family with their pod. This keeps the family together through thick and thin. They hunt together, play together, and mourn the loss of a family memeber together. They share food, even the smallest fish, because sharing and working as a group is what keeps the pod together and well. The lifestyle in captivity is not the same whatsoever and must be changed so that the whales can go back to behaving like they know best; in the wild.</p>
