      <h1>Reasons Captivity Needs To End</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Previous analyses using data through 1992 showed that captive orcas have higher mortality rates than wild orcas; new analyses examining data through 2010 confirm that the situation has not improved in the past 18 years, and in fact has worsened. Captivity is, in essence, poor habitat for orcas, causing early death.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Captive female orcas give birth too young and too often, leading to both high adult and high infant mortality.</li>
        <li>The most common cause of death for captive orcas is infection. Chronic stress may be an important factor in weakening the animals&rsquo; immune response.</li>
        <li>Captive orcas have poor dental health compared to wild whales, which may be another factor in their susceptibility to fatal infections.</li>
        <li>Orcas in captivity are more aggressive toward each other than in the wild. Females also behave abnormally toward their calves more often than in the wild.</li>
        <li>Since captive orcas have been publicly displayed, they have seriously threatened the lives and safety of dozens of people, and four people have been killed. However, wild orcas have injured only a handful of people — none seriously — and there are no records, at any time in history, of them killing anyone.</li>
