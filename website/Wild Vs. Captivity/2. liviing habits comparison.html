      <h1>Living Habits Comparison</h1>
      <p><img src="../Images/Wild Vs. Captivity Images/stats-on-lifestyle.jpg" width="300" height="300"></p>
      <p>CAPTIVITY:</p>
      <p>· At least 134 orcas have been taken into captivity from the wild since 1961. One<br>
        hundred and six (79%) are now dead. (An additional male escaped after 2.25<br>
        years in captivity. His fate is unknown.)<br>
        · Of the 107 which died, average length of survival in captivity was under six years<br>
        (range: 1 day - 27.2 years).<br>
        · Most captives die before they reach their early 20s, yet in the wild, females may<br>
        live as long as 80 years or more.<br>
        · As of August 2000, a total of 49 orcas (26 wild-caught and 23 captive-born<br>
        calves) are held in 13 marine parks in five countries.<br>
        1 There is also a male<br>
        orca, Keiko, now in a seapen in his native Icelandic waters, as the second stage<br>
        of a rehabilitation and release programme.<br>
        · Of 59 known pregnancies in captivity since 1968, only 23 calves (38%) have<br>
        survived.<br>
        · Sea World owns 22 orcas, 44% of the world-wide captive total. Around 10<br>
        million people visit Sea World parks annually. Sea World has itself estimated<br>
        that as much as 70% of its income derives from visitors attracted by the orca<br>
        shows.2<br>
        Now the facade. Enjoy the show...<br>
        To the orcas circling endlessly in the holding pool, it is merely the start of the third, or<br>
        the fourth, or the fifth show of the day. This performance is likely to be identical to the<br>
        last and the one before that. Today will eventually join a long line of yesterdays as the<br>
        orcas clock up yet another day in captivity. A day that will join the weeks, which turn<br>
        into months, which blend seamlessly into years.<br>
        To the spectators filing into the stadium, clutching cameras and popcorn, the show<br>
        which is about to start is eagerly anticipated as the highlight of their visit to Sea World.<br>
        Yet, these surroundings are not unique to Sea World's marine parks. The tiers of benches<br>
        ranged around the concrete stadium, allowing spectators an uninterrupted view of the<br>
        show pool with its unnaturally 'superclear' water and Plexiglas sides, are echoed in other<br>
        orca parks elsewhere in the US, or in Canada, France, Argentina or Japan. But Sea<br>
        World is clear victor in the battle for superlatives: it own the most orcas, has the largest<br>
        pools, its shows are the most highly-choreographed, and it derives the most profit from its<br>
        showbiz cetaceans.<br>
        As the audience takes their seats, their attention is drawn to a giant video screen which<br>
        dominates the small stage at the rear of the pool. As hidden cameras pan around the<br>
        stadium, visitors point and wave delightedly as they recognise themselves on the big<br>
        screen. The performance warms up with 'Shamu's Quiz'. Question after question is<br>
        flashed onto the screen and the audience is asked to raise a hand or nod their head in<br>
        response to such brainteasers as 'Are killer whales fish or mammals?'<br>
        As the quiz screen fades, four trainers run on-stage, dressed in sleek, red and black<br>
        wetsuits. The piped music, previously just 'acoustic wallpaper', now swells to a<br>
        triumphant crescendo and the crowd, entering into the spirit of the show, eagerly claps<br>
        and cheers the trainers' arrival. The audience becomes aware of the orcas circling in<br>
        the holding area, but before the whales are allowed to enter the show pool, the huge<br>
        screen flickers once more into life. An avuncular narrator explains some of the myths<br>
        and legends associated with killer whales. These 'great black fish, rulers of the sea' are<br>
        'relentless predators, with enormous strength and a ferocious nature' and a 'tremendous<br>
        capacity for killing and eating'. Brief footage is shown of a wild orca pod off Vancouver<br>
        Island. But by now, the audience is losing concentration.<br>
        Two orcas have been let into the main show pool and are circling. The larger of the<br>
        two, its dorsal fin flopped rather pathetically over to one side, makes several rapid<br>
        circuits of the pool, leaping in a rather perfunctory way at precisely the same spot each<br>
        time, accompanied by 'oohs and ahs' from the crowd. The voice of the on-screen<br>
        narrator continues its description of orcas, '..four tons of streamlined muscle and bone'.5<br>
        At precisely the moment that his disembodied voice is describing the orca's 'interlocking<br>
        teeth designed for ripping and tearing', one of 'these monstrous juggernauts of the deep'<br>
        docilely approaches the stage, to be rewarded by a trainer who doles out a handful of<br>
        dead fish from a steel bucket. The intense irony of this moment is lost on the audience.<br>
        The screen changes once more and, to the accompaniment of rock music blaring from<br>
        the huge speakers, the show proper begins. This time, the giant screen simultaneously<br>
        relays the action taking place in the pool, both above and below the water. A quick<br>
        circuit, then, as the music reaches a crescendo, an orca heads straight for the<br>
        audience. On cue, it lunges forward, propelling its entire body out of the water and<br>
        hauling itself onto a shallow shelf which runs along the front of the tank. Flipping its tail<br>
        up, the orca 'bows' to the delighted crowd.<br>
        Sliding back into the unnaturally clear water, it joins the other orca for a medley of<br>
        highly-choreographed twirls, spyhops, flipper waves and tail slaps. An orca responds<br>
        again to the trainer's cue, moving obediently to the poolside and allowing its back to be<br>
        stroked. A female trainer now explains to the crowd that its skin 'feels like hard rubber.'<br>
        On cue, the orca splashes. Standing on its tail, it waves both pectoral fins at the crowd<br>
        and spits water 'playfully'. The crowd shrieks with laughter. The front benches are always<br>
        packed, in gleeful expectation of a soaking from 'Shamu'.<br>
        But even these endearing antics serve merely as a warm-up in preparation for the real<br>
        spectacle to come: 'Playtime with the whales'. A wetsuited male trainer now moves from<br>
        the poolside and onto the back of the larger orca. As gentle music plays, the orca<br>
        carries him slowly across the pool. Sliding from the whale's glistening back, both trainer<br>
        and orca roll over in the water, floating together, to a chorus of sentimental 'ahs' from<br>
        the spectators.<br>
        In an instant, the music swells once more and, in a flurry of spray, the trainer reappears,<br>
        this time crouching on the orca's head before moving nimbly to stand upright, clasping<br>
        the whale's chin, both feet balancing on the orca's front flippers. Slipping back into the<br>
        water, he emerges again, this time kneeling astride the orca's back.<br>
        Standing up, he balances upon its back, 'logrolling', as they move to the poolside where<br>
        he leaps deftly back on stage, amid a roar of applause. A reward of dead fish and the<br>
        trainer remounts the orca, swimming the pool's width underwater and emerging as the<br>
        orca once more 'beaches' itself upon the shallow shelf, this time with his trainer still<br>
        aboard. A child is chosen from the audience and is briefly lifted onto 'Shamu's' back by<br>
        a smiling female trainer. Cameras flash and then the action continues.<br>
        A second trainer now dives into the water to join the smaller orca. Floating on his back<br>
        in the water, he is pushed around the pool by the whale, to the accompaniment of fasttempo<br>
        music, the crowd clapping in time with the beat. Right on cue, both disappear<br>
        beneath the surface. For a brief moment as the crowd holds its breath in anticipation,<br>
        neither are visible. Then, in a turmoil of cheers and spray, the trainer re-emerges.<br>
        Propelled upwards out of the water by the three-ton orca, he balances triumphantly for<br>
        an instant upon the whale's nose.<br>
        More gravity-defying stunts follow, as the trainers, propelled dramatically into the air by<br>
        their proteges, dive gracefully back into the water as the crowd roars approval. The<br>
        music swells into the finale, punctuated by the dramatic breaches of the two orcas. The<br>
        show climaxes with a final spectacular backflip, and the audience begins to file out.<br>
        The stadium is now silent and the orcas are returned once more to the narrow confines<br>
        of the holding pool. Their only certainty being that tomorrow will bring another such<br>
        show... and another .. and another.<br>
        In order to understand just how alien this existence is for the orcas, we need first to<br>
        develop an understanding of the day to day routines and complex social relationships<br>
        enjoyed by orcas in the wild. The following section paints a picture of daily life in a wild<br>
        orca pod.</p>
      <p>WILD: </p>
      <p>Researchers in British Columbia and Washington State have identified three distinct<br>
        forms of orcas which fundamentally differ in many aspects of their social organisation,<br>
        behaviour, appearance, diet and even dialect. The first group, by far the most studied,<br>
        are known as residents. The resident orcas are further divided into two communities<br>
        whose territorial waters do not overlap. The first community of orcas, totalling around 200 individuals in 1999, spends most ofits time in the waters off northern Vancouver Island and thus has been named the<br>
        northern resident community. A second community of 84 whales (summer 1999 census),<br>
        whose home range lies off south-eastern Vancouver Island, is known as the southern<br>
        resident community. These two groups have never been observed to interact.<br>
        Residents live in stable social groups, known as pods, which typically contain between<br>
        10 - 20 members. They feed predominantly upon salmon for most of the year: frequent<br>
        sightings off Vancouver Island between June and October coincide with the salmon<br>
        migrations. A second distinct form of orcas, totalling around 170 individuals to date, is believed to<br>
        be both socially and genetically isolated from the residents. These whales, known as<br>
        'transients', appear to occupy a much wider home range, travel in much smaller groups<br>
        of one to five individuals and generally seem to possess a more fluid social structure<br>
        than the residents. They vocalise much less frequently than the residents and dive for<br>
        longer periods, spending much more time underwater. Although the territorial waters of transients and residents frequently overlap, the two groups apparently do not interbreed or even interact socially. Indeed, they often seem<br>
        uncomfortable in each others' presence and appear either to ignore or directly avoid<br>
        the other, or (as has recently been observed), residents may 'chase off' the transients.<br>
        In recent years, a third form has been identified. Dubbed 'offshores', this little-studied<br>
        population has been observed in the Pacific Ocean, around 24 - 40km (15-25 miles) off9<br>
        Vancouver Island. These orcas tend to travel in larger groups of 30 - 60 individuals. To<br>
        date, around 200 offshores have been identified (1993 figs). Population estimates for<br>
        both transient and offshore groups are likely to evolve as studies progress.<br>
        Genetic analysis work carried out to date using samples taken from stranded (or captive)<br>
        resident and transient orcas has revealed that these two forms of orcas are genetically<br>
        quite distinct, suggesting that they are separate sub-species or races. In time, genetic<br>
        studies may confirm current speculation that all three forms of orcas identified in this<br>
        region are indeed separate races. Orcas, it seemed, possessed a social life<br>
        that was far richer and more complex than anyone could have imagined. This research<br>
        marked a turning point in our knowledge and understanding of this, the largest member<br>
        of the dolphin family. Orca society is incredibly complex and very highly evolved. As knowledge of the social<br>
        structure of the resident orcas off Vancouver Island has been accumulated, these orcas<br>
        have come to be described as amongst the most closely-bonded animals on earth.<br>
        Social structure - at least, among the resident orcas studied - runs entirely along<br>
        maternal lines, hence the basic unit of orca society is known as a matrilineal group.<br>
        Typically, such a group consists of a mature female and all her offspring, including<br>
        adult sons who remain with their mothers for life. Adult daughters and their offspring also<br>
        travel in this extended family group, which may span three or even four generations and<br>
        may contain as many as nine whales.  The bonds formed are long-term and only death or capture can sever these<br>
        family ties. Researchers have never known any individual to move permanently from<br>
        one subpod to another. A 'pod' is a larger social unit, an extended family group composed of several subpods<br>
        and most number between 10 - 20 individuals. A typical pod might consist of a few<br>
        closely-related females (probably sisters or cousins) and all their offspring. Thus a pod<br>
        will include grandmothers, mothers, aunts, sisters, brothers and cousins - but fathers are<br>
        conspicuously absent. Females typically give birth to their first calf at around 14-15 years and will have an<br>
        average of five calves over roughly a 25 year period, although the gap between calves<br>
        can range between two and 12 years. Calf mortality is fairly high; nevertheless, around<br>
        60% of calves survive the crucial first year. Like humans, but unlike most other<br>
        mammals, orcas stop bearing calves around the age of 40-55 and probably stop<br>
        ovulating. Females may live a further 20 or more years after bearing their last calf and,10<br>
        since some individuals may reach 80 or more years, most mothers will be alive<br>
        throughout their son's entire lives. Male lifespan is shorter, generally a maximum of 50-<br>
        60 years, hence the senior members of any pod are likely to be female. Daily life in an orca pod tends to follow a comfortable routine composed of foraging for food, travelling, resting and socialising or play behaviour. Throughout the day, theemphasis is firmly upon the social.<br>
        Orcas, like many other highly successful predators, place great emphasis upon<br>
        socialising and playing. Play seems to assume an important role in orca society,<br>
        probably helping individuals to bond and allowing juveniles to learn social and sexual<br>
        behaviours from older pod members. The action tends to be fast and furious and can<br>
        take the form of breaching and spy -hopping above the water and rolling and tail<br>
        thrashing at the surface. Calves appear to delight in playing 'chase me Charlie' or<br>
        rolling playfully over their mother's or sibling's bodies. Objects such as floating kelp may<br>
        be employed: an orca may drape a long strand over its body whilst diving and swimming<br>
        energetically. In late summer or early autumn, the ultimate in orca social behaviour occurs, when<br>
        several pods get together, to form a 'superpod' of maybe 100-200 whales. Such<br>
        occasions are marked by much excitement and vocalising and researchers believe that<br>
      these highly sociable gatherings also provide the ideal forum for mating to take place.</p>
