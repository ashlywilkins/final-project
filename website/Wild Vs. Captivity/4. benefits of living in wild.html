      <ul>
        <li>Killer Whales get to be with their real family and not a &quot;pod&quot; that is comprised of captive Orcas from around the world.</li>
        <li>Whales get to hubnt regualary and learn to survive on their own and defend for themselves.</li>
        <li>The ocean is their home - not a small tub</li>
        <li>The Ocean is real. It is filled with water that the killer whalew is used to, meant to live in. The unusually clear water at the stadiums that they are kept captive in are not normal living conditions for a killer whale.</li>
        <li>UNLIMITED SPACE in the ocean!! They can roam free, play freely with their friends and family, and go whevere they wish because they are FREE!</li>
        <li>No killings have been recorded from interacting with killer whales in the wild</li>
        <li>When killer whales are kept in the wild we have more whales to study and learn from them in their natural habitat</li>
        <li>They get to stay with their babies.. unlike being captive where the mothers calf is taken away from her as soon as it is old enough to perform on its own. Killer whales know when they are seperated from a member of their family and after they are they will spend days &quot;crying,&quot; &quot;screaming,&quot; and not interacting with other whales.</li>
        <li>Killer whales do not attack other killer whales in the wild. Though their aredifferent &quot;races&quot; of killer whales in the wild, they do not attack other races. Instead they ignore them and go abvout whatever they are doing.</li>
        <li>Killer whales are absolutely stunning and meant to be kept in the wild. Watching them in their own environment is much more fulfilling than watching them as they are kept in a tiny tank working for our entertainiment and having no joy in their own lives.</li>
