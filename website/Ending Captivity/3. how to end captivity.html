      <h1>How To End Captivity</h1>
      <p><img src="../Images/Ending Captivity Images/how-to-stop-it.jpg" width="300" height="300">This growing uneasiness with the concept of keeping orcas in captivity has only been increased by the renowned documentary Blackfish, documenting the reality of the captives' existence. Despite the best attempts of the display industry to blow a smokescreen over such negative publicity, the wider world is now increasingly aware that all is not well in fantasy-land. In recent years, first a trickle, then a steady torrent, of incidents have been reported. A growing catalogue of 'accidents', illnesses, failed pregnancies and premature deaths that have helped to show up this industry for the cruel circus that it really is. To end captivity, people need to stop attending shows and supporting the business. By boycotting the shows and not paying to see such cruelty, the parks will have no choice but to shut down. </p>
