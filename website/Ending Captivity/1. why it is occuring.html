      <h1>Why is Orca Captivity Occuring?</h1>
      <p><img src="../Images/Ending Captivity Images/why-its-happening.jpg" width="300" height="300">Orca Captivity is happening in The United States and even outaside of our nation for the entertainimnemt for those that think giant animals being squished into little tanks is amusing. People all around the world are paying money to come see killer whales perform in extremely tiny tanks for their enjoyment. Orca Whales are very intelligent animals and therefore are fairly simple to train. They are also very friends (when not in cpativity) which makes them ideal for shows, much like dolphins or seals. Ususally the orcas are happy mammals and interact well with their trainers but there have been many situations where this is not the case. Orca captivity is only still occuring because people are still paying to see them. Sea World has seen a very dramatic loss in their customers coming to shows but not enough of a loss to shut down their business.</p>
