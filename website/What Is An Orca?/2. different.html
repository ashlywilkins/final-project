      <h1>How Are They Differen't?</h1>
      <p><img src="../Images/What Is An Orca Images/different-from-other-animals.jpg" width="300" height="300" class="finalproject">Killer whales have the second-heaviest brains among marine mammals[140] (after Sperm whales, which have the largest brain of any animal). They can be trained in captivity and are often described as intelligent,[141][142]although defining and measuring "intelligence" is difficult in a species whose environment and behavioral strategies are very different from those of humans.Killer whales imitate others, and seem to deliberately teach skills to their kin. Off the Crozet Islands, mothers push their calves onto the beach, waiting to pull the youngster back if needed. People who have interacted closely with killer whales offer numerous anecdotes demonstrating the whales' curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. Alaskan killer whales have not only learned how to steal fish from longlines, but also have overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys.[143] Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal the catch as it was being retrieved. A researcher described what happened next:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"It worked really well for a while. Then the whales split into two groups. It didn't even take them an hour to figure it out. They were so thrilled when they figured out what was going on, that we were playing games. They were breaching by the boats."</p></blockquote>
        <p>In other anecdotes, researchers describe incidents in which wild killer whales playfully tease humans by repeatedly moving objects the humans are trying to reach,[144] or suddenly start to toss around a chunk of ice after a human throws a snowball. The killer whale's use of dialects and the passing of other learned behaviours from generation to generation have been described as a form of animal culture.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"The complex and stable vocal and behavioural cultures of sympatric groups of killer whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) appear to have no parallel outside humans and represent an independent evolution of cultural faculties."</p>
      </blockquote>
