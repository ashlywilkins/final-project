      <h1>Male Vs. Female</h1>
      <p><img src="../Images/What Is An Orca Images/Male-vs-female.jpg" width="300" height="300">When killer whales jump into the air from the water, called breaching, they expose their undersides to view, thereby presenting one way for observers to distinguish males from females. Down towards the tail flukes, between the navel and the anus, a female orca has a white, oval-shaped genital patch with three black spots. The largest one, in the middle, is her vagina, and the two on either side of it are the mammary slits containing the nipples she uses for nursing her calves, which are retracted into her body when not in use. The genital area of the male orca is in the same region of his body but more elongated, with a single black slit covering his penis. Male orcas are much larger and heavier than females, growing as long as 32 feet and weighing 11 tons, while females grow up to 28 feet in length but tip the scales at 7 tons. The size of the dorsal fin is also a strong indication of gender. Adult males, called bulls, have dorsal fins about 6 feet high and triangular in shape, but the dorsal fins of females are only half as tall and more sickle-shaped than triangular. Since it takes up to 20 years for the dorsal fin of males to "sprout" to full size, a young male can be mistaken for an adult female. The flippers of adult males are also longer and broader than those of females.</p>
